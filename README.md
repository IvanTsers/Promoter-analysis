# Promoter-analysis
  These scripts are to search cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within gene promoter regions using position weight matrices (PWMs) obtained from PlantPAN3.0 (http://plantpan.itps.ncku.edu.tw/index.html) and MAST tool from MEME suite (http://meme-suite.org/). The extraction of gene promoter regions is supposed to be performed using extract_promoters.sh shell script (https://github.com/RimGubaev/extract_promoters).
