May have a function in the deetiolation process. Confers sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), and regulates the ABA signaling pathway during seed germination, upon nitrate-mediated lateral root inhibition, in hexokinase-dependent sugar responses (including feed-back regulation of photosynthesis and mobilization of storage lipid during germination), and in response to osmotic stress mediated by NaCl, KCl or mannitol. Plays a role in sucrose sensing or signaling, especially at low fluence far red light. Also involved in plant response to glucose treatment, especially at low concentration and in young seedlings. Required for the trehalose-mediated root inhibition and starch accumulation in cotyledons, probably by inhibiting starch breakdown. However, seems to not be involved in sugar-mediated senescence. Required for the ABA-dependent beta-amino-butyric acid (BABA) signaling pathway. BABA primes ABA synthesis and promotes resistance to drought and salt, and leads to a prime callose accumulation that confers resistance against necrotrophic pathogens such as A.brassicicola and P.cucumerina. Seems to be involved in resistance to S.sclerotiorum probably by regulating the ABA-mediated stomatal closure apparently by antagonistic interaction with oxalate. Negative regulator of low water potential-induced Pro accumulation whose effect is decreased by high levels of sugar.
